This adds some more features on top of the [start
branch](https://github.com/debboutr/cbsdb/tree/start)

A few things I plan to do soon:
- migrate all 'templates' to be contained within the app [bike] -
 I think this will be better for the case if we add standalone apps for
 login or volunteer management
- create some example 'static' files in the [bikes] app and insure storing in
  'bikes/static/bikes/' works
- create a page that displays bike data from a drop down menu
