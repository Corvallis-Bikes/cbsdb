This adds some more features on top of the [start
branch](https://github.com/debboutr/cbsdb/tree/start)

Additions:
- Master template - base_generic.html
- Migrate all 'templates' to be contained within the app [bike] -
 I think this will be better for the case if we add standalone apps for
 login or volunteer management
- New index page that displays number of bikes
- Example 'static' file [img] in bikes add

A few things I plan to do soon:
- create a page that displays bike data from a drop down menu
