This Project was started to create an Open Source, modern language version of
the bike and used database and POS system the [Corvallis Bicycle
Collective](www.corvallisbikes.org) has
been using for a number of years. We hope this will eventually be useful to
other community bike projects around the country and the world.

Images of the MS Access forms and a text file with the VBA code from the original database can be found in the
[OLDDB Branch](https://github.com/debboutr/cbsdb/tree/OLDDB/OldCBCDB)

Any help is greatly appreciated.
We are trying to track any ideas or feature concepts as issues.

Current development is in very early stages and is slow.

Some (Not much) more info can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/debboutr/cbsdb/wiki) page.
